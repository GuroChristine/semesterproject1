        <h1>Welcome to the community science museum !</h1>
        <p>
            Come join us at the community science museum where we’re commited to making science accesible to all.

            over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
            
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and prehaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            
            We believe science should not be confined by a textbook, but brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varies subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibitis are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - the only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
