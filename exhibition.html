                    <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                    <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastick exhibition, ‘The sky above us’, explores the night sky<br>
                        and what we can see and know about the universe around us. we’ll locate the various constellations and<br>
                        galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>
                        <br>
                        Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galilleo’s telescope, to the latest<br>
                        exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wreseled with the question of our origins. Where do we<br>
                    come from and how did we get here ? since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a<br>
                    framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. <br>
                    <br>
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today has evolved our time. You<br>
                    can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our wooly<br>
                    mammoth, the dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too. </p>

                <h2>Biology and Medicin</h2>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique<br>
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.<br>
                    <br>
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much inproved, thanks to<br>
                    the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of<br>
                    medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of pencillin and the first<br>
                    heart transplant. 
                    <br>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing<br>
                    animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it. </p>

                <h2>Robotics and Al</h2>
                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.<br>
                    From useful home applications of Al to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say<br>
                    hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it<br>
                    becomes that scientists explore how to create a suistainable future not just for humans but for the<br>
                    planet. <br>

                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,<br>
                    extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a<br>
                    brighter future.</p>
