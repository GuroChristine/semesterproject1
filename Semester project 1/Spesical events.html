                <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over bedside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.</p>

                <div class="energetica"></div>
                <p>On loan from the NEMO science museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is comming to the community science museum. It’s a series of instalations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy power lighting, to ‘wind island’ that showes how turbines are able to use and controll wind to create power.</p>
